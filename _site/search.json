    "text": "This is an example workflow to identify gaps in a biodiversity database (like GBIF or iNaturalist), and to generate raster maps where each cell is assigned a priority level for sampling in a bioblitz event.\nEach map will cross biodiversity priorities with accessibility to identify the cells that are easiest to sample while helping to fill a biodiversity data gap. Gaps will be defined based on “Challenges” that will be part of the Blitz the Gap event.\nHere, we will build an example challenge to encourage community scientists to update historical records of amphibians.\n\n\nLoad packages:\n\nlibrary(dplyr) \nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(mapview)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(here)\n\nSet some mapview options to apply to all the maps we will make here:\n\nmapviewOptions(basemaps = c(\"OpenStreetMap\"),\n               na.color = \"transparent\")\n\n\n\nLoad spatial layers that we will use to make sure all of our layers match (in terms of the grid resolution and projection).\n\n# Canada polygon\ncanada = sf::read_sf(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada-polygon/canada.outline.shp\")\n\n# Base grid for rasterizing\nbase.5k = terra::rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada.base.5k.tiff\")\n\n# Mask water and built areas\nbase.water &lt;- rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/WaterUrbanBuiltMask.tif\")\nbase.water&lt;-project(base.water, crs(base.5k))\nbase.water&lt;-resample(base.water, base.5k, method='near')\nterra::writeRaster(base.water, here::here(\"data/clean/base-layers/WaterUrbanBuiltMask.tif\"), overwrite=TRUE)\n\n# Make a reverse of the base layer to remove cells that we don't want to consider (later)\nanti.base=base.5k\nanti.base[is.na(anti.base)] &lt;- 1\nanti.base[anti.base==2] &lt;- NA\nanti.base[base.water==1] &lt;- 1\nterra::writeRaster(anti.base, here::here(\"data/clean/base-layers/anti.base.5k.tif\"), overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will use GBIF data, though later steps will be similarly useful to process iNaturalist data. Here, let’s use a download of all amphibian data in Canada.\n\n# Download the GBIF data through the GBIF data website. Make sure to save the citation details from the download in a text file alongside the data.\n# Unzip in the data/raw/gbif/your_taxa_of_choice folder\n# Read in the dataset and select columns we need\ngbif = data.table::fread(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/biodiversity-data/amphibians/0007149-250127130748423.csv\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters &lt; 100000) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(family, scientificName, year,\n         decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, coordinatePrecision,\n         datasetKey, basisOfRecord)\n\nFirst, we need to prepare the GBIF data into a spatial object:\n\n# Convert GBIF to a points layer\ngbif.v &lt;- vect(gbif,\n               geom=c(\"decimalLongitude\",\"decimalLatitude\"),\n             crs=\"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84\",\n             keepgeom = TRUE)\n\n# Project GBIF \ngbif.v &lt;- project(gbif.v, crs(base.5k))\n\n# Remove occurrences outside the canada polygon\ngbif.v = terra::crop(gbif.v, canada)\n\nNow we can convert the GBIF data into raster layers:\n\ngbif.density: count of GBIF observations per cell\nmuseum.density: count of GBIF observations from preserved specimens (museums) per cell\niNat.density: count of GBIF observations from iNaturalist (dataset key: \"50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7\") per cell\nyear.last.sampled: year of the last GBIF observation in GBIF per cell\n\n\n# Make a GBIF density layer\ngbif.density &lt;- rasterize(gbif.v, base.5k, fun=\"count\")\n\n# Density of museum observations\nmuseum.density &lt;- rasterize(gbif.v[which(gbif.v$basisOfRecord == \"PRESERVED_SPECIMEN\")], base.5k, fun=\"count\")\n\n# Density of observations from iNaturalist alone\niNat.density &lt;- rasterize(gbif.v[which(gbif.v$datasetKey == \"50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7\")], base.5k, fun=\"count\")\n\n# Raster of the latest observation's year\nyear.last.sampled &lt;- rasterize(gbif.v, base.5k, fun=\"max\", field=\"year\")\n\n# Stack the GBIF layers into one object for easy saving\ngbif.layers = c(gbif.density,museum.density,iNat.density,year.last.sampled)\nnames(gbif.layers) = c(\"gbif.density\",\"museum.density\",\"iNat.density\",\"year.last.sampled\")\ngbif.layers[is.na(base.5k)]&lt;-NA\n\n# save\nwriteRaster(gbif.layers, here::here(\"data/clean/biodiversity-data/rasters/gbif.layers.amphibians.tif\"), overwrite = TRUE)\nwriteVector(gbif.v, here::here(\"data/clean/biodiversity-data/points/gbif.points.amphibians.shp\"), overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these layers are originally from the GEOBON STAC catalog, which can be viewed here: https://stac.geobon.org/viewer/. Instructions about how to retrieve these layers and download them for use are here: Working with STAC.\nThis is some code to reproject and resample the rasters from the STAC to match the GBIF density layers, after downloading them following the instructions linked above.\n\n\nClimate velocity (a metric of how quickly the climate will change by 2085 in each cell, under RCP85):\n\nvel &lt;- rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/challenges/climate/climatevelocity_adaptwest_fwvel_ensemble_rcp85_2085.tif\")\nvel&lt;-project(vel,base.5k,\"bilinear\")\nvel&lt;-resample(vel,base.5k,method='near')\nvel[is.na(base.5k)] &lt;- NA\nterra::writeRaster(vel, here::here(\"data/clean/challenges/climate/climatevelocity_adaptwest_fwvel_ensemble_rcp85_2085.tif\"), overwrite=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nDistance to roads:\n\ndist.to.roads&lt;-rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/distance.to.roads.tif\")\ndist.to.roads&lt;-project(dist.to.roads,base.5k,\"bilinear\")\ndist.to.roads[is.na(base.5k)]&lt;-NA\nterra::writeRaster(dist.to.roads, here::here(\"data/clean/base-layers/dist.to.roads.tif\"),overwrite = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Copy the layer into a new object that we'll edit\nresamp &lt;- gbif.layers$year.last.sampled\nmapview(resamp, \n        na.color = \"transparent\")\n\nNumber of pixels is above 5e+05.Only about 5e+05 pixels will be shown.\nYou can increase the value of `maxpixels` to 986203 to avoid this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will assign priority values to cells based on the year they were last sampled. These are the priority levels we will use:\n\n\n\nPriority\nOldest observation\nNewest observation\n\n\n\n\nHigh (1)\noldest\n1950\n\n\nMedium (2)\n1951\n2000\n\n\nLow (3)\n2001\n2015\n\n\nNot a priority (4)\n2016\n2025\n\n\n\nLet’s assign these values based on the condition that the year last sampled in GBIF is within those year limits:\n\nresamp[gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &lt;= 1950] &lt;- 1\nresamp[gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &gt; 1950 & gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &lt;= 2000] &lt;- 2\nresamp[gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &gt; 2000 & gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &lt;= 2015] &lt;- 3\nresamp[gbif.layers$year.last.sampled &gt; 2015] &lt;- 4\n\nLet’s map this to see what we’re working with!\n\nmapview(resamp)\n\nNumber of pixels is above 5e+05.Only about 5e+05 pixels will be shown.\nYou can increase the value of `maxpixels` to 986203 to avoid this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make a mask of the pixels we consider to be accessible. Let’s say anything within 10 km of a major road is potentially accessible, so we’re only interested in these cells:\n\nd10 = dist.to.roads\nd10[d10&gt;10000] &lt;- NA # assign NA to pixels that are over 10 km away from a major road\nmapview(d10)\n\nNumber of pixels is above 5e+05.Only about 5e+05 pixels will be shown.\nYou can increase the value of `maxpixels` to 986203 to avoid this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can use this same condition (ignore anything where dist.to.roads &gt; 10000) to select cells from the priority layer that are accessible:\n\npal = viridis::viridis(n = 3, direction = -1)\npriority = resamp\npriority[dist.to.roads &gt; 10000] &lt;- NA\nmapview(priority, \n        col.regions = pal)\n\nNumber of pixels is above 5e+05.Only about 5e+05 pixels will be shown.\nYou can increase the value of `maxpixels` to 986203 to avoid this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s visualize this a little differently, so it is easier to explore. We will make a point layer with the year in which the cell was last sampled, and this layer is resized as we zoom in and out so it is easier to have a quick view of the map. When we zoom in, we will see the cell the point is referring to, so we make sure we’re still identifying the exact cell outline that we’d be asking people to go sample.\n\nlast.year = gbif.layers$year.last.sampled\nlast.year[priority &gt; 3] &lt;- NA\nlast.year[dist.to.roads &gt; 10000] &lt;- NA\n\nhistorical_pts = last.year |&gt;\n  raster::raster() |&gt;\n  raster::rasterToPoints(fun = function(x){x&lt;2016}, spatial = TRUE)\n\nhistorical_cells = priority |&gt;\n  raster::raster() |&gt;\n  raster::rasterToPolygons(fun = function(x){x &lt; 4})\n\npal = viridis::viridis(n = 3, direction = -1)\n(m = mapview(historical_cells, \n        legend = TRUE, \n        basemaps = \"OpenStreetMap\",  \n        col.regions = pal,\n        layer.name = \"Priority\") +\n  mapview(historical_pts,\n          col.regions = pal,\n          legend = FALSE, \n          layer.name = \"Year last \\nsampled\"))\n\nWarning: Found less unique colors (3) than unique zcol values (80)! \nInterpolating color vector to match number of zcol values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtmlwidgets::saveWidget(m@map, \n                        file = here::here(\"challenges/maps/challenge1_map.html\"), \n                        title = \"Revisit the past: Amphibians\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a project on iNaturalist that includes observations within polygons, we need to convert our raster into a KML file. From this KML file, we can make a “Place” on iNaturalist, which we can then set up for each challenge.\nFirst, we will convert our raster to polygons using the raster package:\n\n# make a raster layer to convert \npriority_map = priority\n# remove lowest priority level to only have 3 levels\npriority_map[priority &gt; 3] &lt;- NA\n\n# convert raster to polygons\nhistorical_poly = raster::raster(priority_map) |&gt;\n  raster::rasterToPolygons(n = 4, \n                           na.rm = TRUE)\n\n## Merge polygons that are touching into one polygon\n# convert to sf object\nhistorical_poly = sf::st_as_sf(historical_poly) \n\n# write polygons as a kml file\nsf::st_write(historical_poly, \n             driver = \"KML\", \n             dsn = here::here(\"data/outputs/kml/historical-amphibians.kml\"),\n             delete_layer = TRUE) # overwrite existing layer\n\nWriting layer `historical-amphibians' to data source \n  `/Users/katherine/Documents/GitHub/blitz-the-gap/data/outputs/kml/historical-amphibians.kml' using driver `KML'\n\n\nWarning in CPL_write_ogr(obj, dsn, layer, driver,\nas.character(dataset_options), : GDAL Message 1: Layer name\n'historical-amphibians' adjusted to 'historical_amphibians' for XML validity.\n\n\nWriting 435 features with 1 fields and geometry type Polygon."

KBAs are an important building block for biodiversity conservation in Canada because they represent a standardized, transparent and credible information tool that Canadian conservation organizations and scientists have embraced. KBAs are already being used by governments, funders, and NGOs across the country in protected area planning, land use planning, stewardship, restoration, Indigenous-led conservation, biodiversity monitoring, education and inspiration. KBAs are also helping track progress towards federal conservation commitments (such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework).\n“MayBAs” are areas that experts or historical data have identified as places that could be KBAs, but where we need more data to confirm their status.

For most sites, the interactive map will show the specific species of KBA interest at the site to keep a special eye out for, but for many of these places, any information you can help collect about the diversity within them will help. The sites are coloured according to the approximate time (in driving hours) from the nearest city (of at least 10,000 people).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe locations on this map are suggestions and not exact coordinates of where to sample. We cannot determine safety, ownership, or access to these lands. Please verify that you can legally and safely access these sites."

    "title": "Using the iNaturalist Canada parquet file",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For this working group, iNaturalist Canada provided us their data as a parquet file. Parquet is an open source file format that compresses and encodes large datasets for more efficient data storage, and importantly, more efficient retrieval of informaiton within the dataset. This format makes data lighter to handle because it is column-oriented, rather than row-oriented like a CSV file (which quickly gets overwhelming when you have many rows!).\nThis little tutorial will show you how to open the parquet file if you would like to explore it yourself. As a reminder, we have already made density maps from this file, so you may not need to explore it (depending on the challenge you’d like to build)!\nFirst, load the R packages you will need to use to access the density map layers:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dbplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(mapview) # for interactive maps\n\n# set ggplot theme of choice\ntheme_set(ggpubr::theme_pubr())\n\n\n\nNext, we will open the parquet file using the package arrow:\n\ninat_pq &lt;- arrow::open_dataset(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/biodiversity-data/inat-canada/iNat_non_sensitive_data_Jan2025.parquet\")\n\nNote that this isn’t the same as loading iNaturalist Canada as a CSV in your R session. Here, we’re establishing a connection to the database so we can make queries for the data that we really want.\nTake a look at the columns that are available in the file. We’ll use these columns to query the data with dplyr later:\n\ninat_pq$schema\n\nSchema\nOBJECTID: int64\nid: int32\nobserved_on_string: string\nuser_login: string\nquality_grade: string\nlicense: string\nurl: string\ntag_list: string\ndescription: string\nnum_identification_agreements: int32\nnum_identification_disagreements: int32\ncaptive_cultivated: string\nlatitude: double\nlongitude: double\npositional_accuracy: int32\npublic_positional_accuracy: int32\ngeoprivacy: string\ntaxon_geoprivacy: string\ncoordinates_obscured: string\npositioning_method: string\npositioning_device: string\nplace_town_name: string\nplace_county_name: string\nplace_state_name: string\nplace_country_name: string\nplace_admin1_name: string\nplace_admin2_name: string\nspecies_guess: string\nscientific_name: string\ncommon_name: string\niconic_taxon_name: string\ngeometry: binary\n\nSee $metadata for additional Schema metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll query the data we want, and we will finish the query with the collect() command to load the query’s result into this R session.\nHere, we’ll summarise the number of observations per species, per group using dplyr (but you can use other dplyr functions like filter() for example!)\n\nquery &lt;- inat_pq |&gt; \n  \n  # E.g. you could filter by species group:\n  # filter(iconic_taxon_name == \"Aves\") |&gt;\n  \n  # Summarise number of obs per species, per species group\n  group_by(iconic_taxon_name, scientific_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_obs = n()) |&gt; \n  \n  # load the query into our R session\n  collect()\n\nLet’s have a look at the distribution of the number of observations per species, per group.

Here, I removed species with &lt; 5 observations to get rid of some species with mistakes in their names, or that were just higher-level classes, etc. (But you can remove this condition too to make sure you’ve got everything).\n\nquery_under100 = query |&gt;\n  filter(total_obs &lt; 100 & total_obs &gt; 5)\n\nHow many species in each group have fewer than 100 observations?\n\nquery_under100 |&gt; \n  group_by(iconic_taxon_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(nsp = n_distinct(scientific_name)) \n\n# A tibble: 14 × 2\n   iconic_taxon_name   nsp\n   &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Protozoa            159\n 2 Chromista           240\n 3 Actinopterygii      350\n 4 Reptilia             68\n 5 Mollusca            577\n 6 Amphibia             37\n 7 Animalia           1246\n 8 Arachnida           559\n 9 Mammalia            284\n10 Fungi              3045\n11 Aves                577\n12 Insecta            9484\n13 Plantae            5781\n14 &lt;NA&gt;                 91\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the number of observations per species for these under-sampled species.\n\nggplot(data = query_under100) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = total_obs, \n                          fill = iconic_taxon_name),\n                 bins = 10) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(~iconic_taxon_name, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of observations per species\", \n       y = \"Number of species\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that for groups like fungi, insects and plants, there are many species with less than 30 observations!\n\n\n\nLet’s make the iNaturalist query into a spatial object. First, we’ll make a vector layer, which we’ll then transform into a raster layer.\nFor the example, we’ll only do this for plants:\n\nobs &lt;- inat_pq |&gt;\n  # filter to plant species with &lt; 100 observations:\n  filter(scientific_name %in% query_under100$scientific_name,\n         iconic_taxon_name %in% \"Plantae\") |&gt;\n  # select columns we want to keep\n  select(c(longitude, latitude, \n           iconic_taxon_name, \n           scientific_name, \n           coordinates_obscured)) |&gt;\n  collect()\n\nNext, we need the polygon of Canada and a base grid that we’ll use to make our raster.\n\n# Load Canada polygon\ncanada = sf::read_sf(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada-polygon/canada.outline.shp\")\n\n# Read in base grid layer to make the raster\nbase.50k = terra::rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada.base.5k.tiff\") |&gt;\n  # convert to a coarser resolution for this example\n  terra::aggregate(fact = 10)\n\nNext, we convert the iNaturalist data to a vector layer and make sure to project it and to crop out any points that are not within Canada (just in case):\n\n# convert the iNaturalist ob\ninat.v = terra::vect(obs, geom = c(\"longitude\",\"latitude\"),\n             crs=\"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84\")\n# project to match the base grid\ninat.v = terra::project(inat.v, crs(base.50k))\n# crop observations outside of Canada\ninat.v = terra::crop(inat.v, canada)\n\nNow we can convert this vector into a raster of the density of observations of plant species that have &lt; 100 observations in Canada:\n\n# make iNat density layer\nrareplant.density = rasterize(inat.v, base.50k, fun = \"length\")\n\n# plot it!\npal = viridis::turbo(5)\nmapview(rareplant.density, \n        col.regions = pal,\n        layer.name = \"Density\", \n        na.color = \"transparent\")"

There are two resolutions available for each taxonomic group: 100m, and 1km.\nFirst, load the R packages you will need to use to access the density map layers:\n\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mapview)\n\nSet up the connection to the STAC catalog:\n\n# set up\nstac_obj &lt;- stac(\"https://io.biodiversite-quebec.ca/stac/\")\n\n# get iNaturalist heatmaps for Canada\nit_obj &lt;- stac_obj |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"inat_canada_heatmaps\") |&gt;\n  post_request() |&gt; items_fetch()\nit_obj\n\nGet a table showing which layers are available in the catalog:\n\n# See layers in the object\ndf &lt;- data.frame(description=character())\nfor (f in it_obj[['features']]){\n  df &lt;- rbind(df,data.frame(description=f$properties$description)) \n}\ndf$feature_number = 1:nrow(df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescription\nfeature_number\n\n\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Reptilia at 1km resolution\n1\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Reptilia at 100m resolution\n2\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Protozoa at 1km resolution\n3\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Protozoa at 100m resolution\n4\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Plantae at 1km resolution\n5\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Plantae at 100m resolution\n6\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Mollusca at 1km resolution\n7\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Mollusca at 100m resolution\n8\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Mammalia at 1km resolution\n9\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Mammalia at 100m resolution\n10\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Insecta at 1km resolution\n11\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Insecta at 100m resolution\n12\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Fungi at 1km resolution\n13\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Fungi at 100m resolution\n14\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Chromista at 1km resolution\n15\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Chromista at 100m resolution\n16\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Aves at 1km resolution\n17\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Aves at 100m resolution\n18\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Arachnida at 1km resolution\n19\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Arachnida at 100m resolution\n20\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Animalia at 1km resolution\n21\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Animalia at 100m resolution\n22\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Amphibia at 1km resolution\n23\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Amphibia at 100m resolution\n24\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group All at 1km resolution\n25\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group All at 100m resolution\n26\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Actinopterygii at 1km resolution\n27\n\n\nDensity of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group Actinopterygii at 100m resolution\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf\n\nLet’s access one of the layers to map it, as an example. We’ll map the density of iNaturalist observations across all taxa by selecting one of the features we listed in the table above.\nHow do we select one of the layers in the STAC Catalog? You can index them by checking the feature_number column above.\nHere, we want “Density of observations in iNaturalist Canada for species of taxonomic group All at 1km resolution”, which is the 25th layer:\n\n# 37 is the number to change if you want another layer from the STAC\ninat &lt;- read_stars(paste0('/vsicurl/', it_obj[['features']][[25]]$assets[[1]]$href), \n                   proxy = TRUE) # using it as a proxy (not a local download,\n                                 # to save time and space!)\n\nNow, let’s map it!\nFirst, load a polygon of Canada that you can download from the data/raw folder on the Sharepoint (or the 00_rawdata folder on the GitHub repository). Make sure to update the file path to match the folder in which you placed the file when you downloaded it!\n\n# read the Canada polygon\ncanada = sf::read_sf(\"data/raw/base-layers/canada-polygon/canada.outline.shp\")\n\nPrepare the data for plotting, and use ggplot2 to map it!\n\n# crop the raster to canada (to cut off the ocean, USA, etc.)\ninat = sf::st_crop(inat, canada)\n\n# (optional) transform data for easier plotting\n# this will square root each raster cell's value. this could also be log10, etc.\ninat_sqrt = inat |&gt; sqrt()\n\n# map!\nggplot() +\n  geom_stars(data = inat_sqrt, \n             # plotting at a coarser resolution to make this faster\n             downsample = 10, \n             na.action = na.omit) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"turbo\", \n                       end = .5,\n                       na.value = \"transparent\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Density\") +\n  coord_equal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make an interactive map that we can zoom into, we can use the package mapview:\nFirst, let’s some mapview options to apply to all the maps we will make here:\n\nmapviewOptions(basemaps = c(\"OpenStreetMap\"),\n               na.color = \"transparent\")\n\nNow, here’s the map!\n\npal = viridis::turbo(5)\nmapview(inat_sqrt, \n        col.regions = pal, # assign color palette\n        layer.name = \"Density (sqrt)\") \n\nNumber of pixels is above 5e+05.Only about 5e+05 pixels will be shown.\nYou can increase the value of `maxpixels` to 24627120 to avoid this."
