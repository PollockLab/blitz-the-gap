Parquet is an open source file format that compresses and encodes large datasets for more efficient data storage, and importantly, more efficient retrieval of informaiton within the dataset. This format makes data lighter to handle because it is column-oriented, rather than row-oriented like a CSV file (which quickly gets overwhelming when you have many rows!).\n\nThis little tutorial will show you how to open the parquet file if you would like to explore it yourself. As a reminder, we have already made density maps from this file, so you may not need to explore it (depending on the challenge you'd like to build)!\n\nFirst, load the R packages you will need to use to access the density map layers:\n\n```{r, results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dbplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(mapview) # for interactive maps\n\n# set ggplot theme of choice\ntheme_set(ggpubr::theme_pubr())\n```\n\n## Open the parquet file\n\nNext, we will open the parquet file using the package `arrow`:\n\n```{r}\ninat_pq <- arrow::open_dataset(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/biodiversity-data/inat-canada/iNat_non_sensitive_data_Jan2025.parquet\")\n```\n\nNote that this isn't the same as loading iNaturalist Canada as a CSV in your R session. Here, we're establishing a connection to the database so we can make queries for the data that we really want.\n\nTake a look at the columns that are available in the file. We'll use these columns to query the data with `dplyr` later:\n\n```{r}\ninat_pq$schema\n```\n\n## Query the data\n\nNext, we'll query the data we want, and we will finish the query with the `collect()` command to load the query's result into this R session.\n\nHere, we'll summarise the number of observations per species, per group using `dplyr` (but you can use other `dplyr` functions like `filter()` for example!)\n\n```{r}\nquery <- inat_pq |> \n  \n  # E.g. you could filter by species group:\n  # filter(iconic_taxon_name == \"Aves\") |>\n  \n  # Summarise number of obs per species, per species group\n  group_by(iconic_taxon_name, scientific_name) |>\n  summarize(total_obs = n()) |> \n  \n  # load the query into our R session\n  collect()\n```\n\nLet's have a look at the distribution of the number of observations per species, per group. We'll put a vertical line to show the __100 observations/species__ mark, which we'll dive into soon.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = query) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = total_obs,\n                     fill = iconic_taxon_name),\n               alpha = .5, lwd = .1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 100) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of observations per species\",\n       y = \"Density (of species)\",\n       fill = \"Species group\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n```\n\nLet's summarise our initial query to the species group level, to see which groups have more samples:\n\n```{r}\nsummary_query = query |>\n  group_by(iconic_taxon_name) |>\n  summarise(total_obs = sum(total_obs),\n            median_obs = median(total_obs))\n```\n\nThis is just a few lines of code to reorder the species group names according to the number of observations, for prettier plots:\n```{r}\nquery$iconic_taxon_name = factor(query$iconic_taxon_name,\n                                 levels = summary_query$iconic_taxon_name[order(summary_query$median_obs)])\nsummary_query$iconic_taxon_name = factor(summary_query$iconic_taxon_name,\n                                         levels = summary_query$iconic_taxon_name[order(summary_query$total_obs)])\n```\n\nWhich groups have more total samples?\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = summary_query) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = iconic_taxon_name,\n               x = total_obs,\n               fill = iconic_taxon_name),\n           stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n\n## Which species have < 100 observations?\n\nSpecies with under 100 observations are of special interest to iNaturalist, so let's have a look at which species have fewer than 100 observations.\n\nFirst, let's filter our initial query to only retain species with < 100 observations. _Here, I removed species with < 5 observations to get rid of some species with mistakes in their names, or that were just higher-level classes, etc. (But you can remove this condition too to make sure you've got everything)._\n\n```{r}\nquery_under100 = query |>\n  filter(total_obs < 100 & total_obs > 5)\n```\n\nHow many species in each group have fewer than 100 observations?\n\n```{r}\nquery_under100 |> \n  group_by(iconic_taxon_name) |> \n  summarise(nsp = n_distinct(scientific_name)) \n```\n\nLet's have a look at the number of observations per species for these under-sampled species.\n\n```{r, fig.height=10}\nggplot(data = query_under100) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = total_obs, \n                          fill = iconic_taxon_name),\n                 bins = 10) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(~iconic_taxon_name, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of observations per species\", \n       y = \"Number of species\") \n```\n\nWe can see that for groups like fungi, insects and plants, there are many species with less than 30 observations! \n\n## Convert the parquet query into a vector and a raster layer\n\nLet's make the iNaturalist query into a spatial object. First, we'll make a vector layer, which we'll then transform into a raster layer.\n\nFor the example, we'll only do this for plants:\n\n```{r}\nobs <- inat_pq |>\n  # filter to plant species with < 100 observations:\n  filter(scientific_name %in% query_under100$scientific_name,\n         iconic_taxon_name %in% \"Plantae\") |>\n  # select columns we want to keep\n  select(c(longitude, latitude, \n           iconic_taxon_name, \n           scientific_name, \n           coordinates_obscured)) |>\n  collect()\n```\n\nNext, we need the polygon of Canada and a base grid that we'll use to make our raster. \n\n```{r}\n# Load Canada polygon\ncanada = sf::read_sf(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada-polygon/canada.outline.shp\")\n\n# Read in base grid layer to make the raster\nbase.50k = terra::rast(\"~/McGill University/Laura's Lab_Group - BioBlitz/data/raw/base-layers/canada.base.5k.tiff\") |>\n  # convert to a coarser resolution for this example\n  terra::aggregate(fact = 10)\n```\n\nNext, we convert the iNaturalist data to a vector layer and make sure to project it and to crop out any points that are not within Canada (just in case):\n```{r}\n# convert the iNaturalist ob\ninat.v = terra::vect(obs, geom = c(\"longitude\",\"latitude\"),\n             crs=\"+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84\")\n# project to match the base grid\ninat.v = terra::project(inat.v, crs(base.50k))\n# crop observations outside of Canada\ninat.v = terra::crop(inat.v, canada)\n```\n\nNow we can convert this vector into a raster of the density of observations of plant species that have < 100 observations in Canada:\n\n```{r}\n# make iNat density layer\nrareplant.density = rasterize(inat.v, base.50k, fun = \"length\")\n\n# plot it!\npal = viridis::turbo(5)\nmapview(rareplant.density, \n        col.regions = pal,\n        layer.name = \"Density\", \n        na.color = \"transparent\") \n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# What is a parquet file?\n\nFor this working group, iNaturalist Canada provided us their data as a parquet file.
