Laura is a professor, also at McGill, who researchers large-scale patterns of biodiversity, often using data from iNaturalist.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/getting-even.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## What's the problem?\n\nThere are **a lot** of observations on iNaturalist - which is great!
