Have we got a challenge for you!\n\nWhen you're admiring the crazy things you find by the sea why not contribute to biodiversity data and learn about the seaweeds you find along the way.

There are seaweed identification resources like books (e.g. Pacific Seaweeds: A Guide to Common Seaweeds of the West Coast), apps (e.g. https://seaweedsorter.com/), and websites (e.g. https://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/seaweeds-algae-and-seagrasses.html) that have a ton of great information about what to look for and what you should try to take pictures of... apart from that, the iNaturalist Computer Vision (AI) is getting better and better so check those recommendations as well.\n\n## **Best Finds**\n\nWe all love Bull Kelp and Knotted Wrack but we hope you'll also love observing some of the other underreported species you can find in coastal Canadian waters. Here are some neat finds to start you on your seaweed safari treasure hunt:\n\n-   Dead Man's Fingers (*Codium fragile*)\n-   The Five Ribbed Kelp (*Costaria costata*)\n-   Sea Cauliflower (*Leathesia marina*)\n-   The Winged Kelp (*Alaria marginata*) \\*bonus points if your specimen has 'wings' at the base (sporophylls)\n-   Mermaid's Tresses (*Chorda filum*)\n-   Red Eyelet Silk (*Sparlingia pertusa*)\n-   *Mazzaella japonica* which is an invasive species in British Columbia\n\n## **Who created this challenge?**\n\nThis challenge was created by a team of ecologists, graduate students, and community scientists. The [Blitz-the-Gap](https://blitzthegap.org/) umbrella project seeks to increase the number of iNaturalist observations that can be used for science and conservation, and is supported by: Canadian Wildlife Federation, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada, Canada Key Biodiversity Areas, Campus Biodiversity Network, University of British Columbia’s Data4Nature cluster, McGill University, and the Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution, including the [Living Data Project](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/ldp.html).
