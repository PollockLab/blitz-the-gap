The [Blitz-the-Gap](https://blitzthegap.org/) umbrella project seeks to increase the number of iNaturalist observations that can be used for science and conservation, and is supported by: Canadian Wildlife Federation, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada, Canada Key Biodiversity Areas, Campus Biodiversity Network, University of British Columbia’s Data4Nature cluster, McGill University, and the Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution, including the [Living Data Project](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/ldp.html). The working group is led by Laura Pollock, Diane Srivastava, Katherine Hébert, David Hunt, Sandra Emry from McGill University and University of British Columbia.\n\nThis particular challenge was designed by [Laura Pollock](https://qbiodiversity.org/), [Katherine Hébert]((https://katherinehebert.github.io/), [Isaac Eckert](https://www.isaaceckert.ca/), [Pierre Rogy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre-Rogy), and [Janaína Serrano](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janaina-Serrano). Laura is a professor at McGill, who researchers large-scale patterns of biodiversity, often using data from iNaturalist. Katherine is a Postdoctoral Researcher at McGill who researches indicators of biodiversity change. Isaac is a PhD candidate, also at McGill, who studies how climate, biotic interactions, species' functional traits, and landscape connectivity influence the spatial patterns of biodiversity across Canada to inform conservation action. Pierre is a Postdoctoral Researcher at McGill, and an arthropod enthusiast. He researches how to bridge two different fields of ecological theory: ecological stoichiometry and energy channels with computer models, observational studies and manipulative field experiments. Janaína is a PhD candidate at McGill who studies threats to terrestrial vertebrate species, and how these species will respond to those threats in the future. We all use data from sources like iNaturalist to build biodiversity models that help us understand and predict biodiversity and how it is changing.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## What's the gap?\n\nTo understand biodiversity change, we need a record of biodiversity change.
