## What's the gap?

For this challenge, head to your favourite lake, river, pond, or wetland
and start observing!

Did you know? Freshwater habitats are some of the most biodiverse areas in the world!
Although they only cover about 1% of the Earth’s surface, they contain
one third of all described vertebrate species - that’s huge! Freshwater
ecosystems and the species they harbor provide countless services to
Humanity, such as food security, climate regulation, and culture
services.

Unfortunately, freshwater biodiversity has historically received little
interest from politicians, conservation scientists, and the general
public, contributing to a big gap in our data! That’s why we are
counting on you, citizen scientists, to help us blitz this freshwater
gap!

## Where should you go & what should you look for?

For this challenge, head to your favourite lake, river, pond, or wetland
and start observing! Focus all your efforts on capturing photos of fish,
amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, since birds are very
well-documented on iNaturalist already (thanks, Birders!).

To help you find the best spot to visit, we have created a priority site
map (below). On this map, we have categorized lakes and rivers across
the country into four categories:

-   **High priority (#1):** Sites with many organisms that are endemic
    to Canada, and have a low number of observations (less than 5) in
    iNaturalist.

-   **Medium priority (#2):** Sites with many organisms that are endemic
    to Canada, but with many observations in iNaturalist.

-   **Medium priority (#3):** Sites with fewer organisms that are
    endemic to Canada, and have a low number of observations (less
    than 5) in iNaturalist.

-   **Lowest priority (#4):** Sites with fewer organisms that are
    endemic to Canada, and that have many observations in iNaturalist.

Curious fishers, show off your prized catches! Aspiring herpetologists,
spot basking turtles and calling frogs! Invertebrate enthusiasts, turn
over submerged rocks to find aquatic critters! Budding botanists, wade
into shallow waters and soggy wetlands to discover aquatic plants!

## **How will these data be used?**

Since freshwater species are so often overlooked, our knowledge of what
species are present and where they occur is limited. By contributing to
this project, you are helping us better understand the distribution of
freshwater species in Canada! This data is extremely useful, as it
allows us to assess how freshwater species are impacted by humans and
climate change.

Here are some examples of studies that have harnessed iNaturalist
observations to better understand regional biodiversity:

## **How do you join?**

It’s easy! Anytime you observe a Canadian freshwater animal or plant in
any lake, river, or wetland, your observation will automatically be
included as part of the “Make a Splash!” project.

Ready? Set? Blitz the gap!

## **Who created this challenge?**

This challenge was created by a team of ecologists, graduate students,
and community scientists. The [Blitz-the-Gap](https://blitzthegap.org/)
umbrella project seeks to increase the number of iNaturalist
observations that can be used for science and conservation, and is
supported by: Canadian Wildlife Federation, Wildlife Conservation
Society Canada, Canada Key Biodiversity Areas, Campus Biodiversity
Network, University of British Columbia’s Data4Nature cluster, McGill
University, and the Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution,
including the Living Data Project. The working group is led by Laura
Pollock, Diane Srivastava, Katherine Hébert, David Hunt, Sandra Emry
from McGill University and University of British Columbia.

This particular challenge was designed by [Christophe
Brabant](https://qcbs.ca/student-member/?student=3460), a PhD Student at
McGill University who studies threatened freshwater animals and by
[Lindsay
Trottier](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lindsay-Trottier-2), a
PhD Candidate at McGill University who studies aquatic plants.
