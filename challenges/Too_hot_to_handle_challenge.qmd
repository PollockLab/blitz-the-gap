## What's the problem?

Canada’s climate is warming quickly, but more so in some parts of the country than others. You can help scientists and communities track how species are responding to these changes by joining this Blitz-the-Gap project. Record species - any species - in these hotspots for climate change to help build the knowledge that scientists need to propose actions for conservation. We have already found for you the places in Canada that are easy to access, and warming the fastest, but where there are very few if any iNaturalist observations.

## Where should you go?

Any locations on the map! These locations are the easiest way to make a difference in tracking species changes in response to climate warming.

## What should you look for?

We've made a list of species (see the Taxa listed [here](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/blitz-the-gap-too-hot-to-handle)) that are in the top 10% most exposed to climate change. Any observations of these species will be included in the [Blitz the Gap: Too Hot To Handle project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/blitz-the-gap-too-hot-to-handle).

## Who created this challenge?

This challenge was created by a team of ecologists, graduate students, and community scientists. The [Blitz-the-Gap](https://blitzthegap.org/) umbrella project seeks to increase the number of iNaturalist observations that can be used for science and conservation, and is supported by: Canadian Wildlife Federation, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada, Canada Key Biodiversity Areas, Campus Biodiversity Network, University of British Columbia’s Data4Nature cluster, McGill University, and the Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution, including the [Living Data Project](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/ldp.html). The working group is led by Laura Pollock, Diane Srivastava, Katherine Hébert, David Hunt, Sandra Emry from McGill University and University of British Columbia.
