## What's the problem?

In Canada, we have more than 5,000 species recorded of butterflies and moths, one of which is the Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the fifth most recorded species in the country. Thatâ€™s awesome! 

Unfortunately, most of these species have only been recorded a few times in specific locations, and we lack further information about them. You can help! Next time you're outside, whether on a hike or doing fieldwork, take a photo of any butterflies or moths you see and upload it to iNaturalist. 

Or if you're interested in contributing checklist data and recording your observations in a more structured way, check out [eButterfly](https://www.e-butterfly.org/ebapp/en)

## **Where should you go?**

All Canada!

Whenever you're doing an outdoor activity, look for butterflies and moths, take a picture and upload it in the iNaturalist app. Every observation counts.
