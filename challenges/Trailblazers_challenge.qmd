## What's the problem?

Did you know that most iNaturalist observations made by hikers are taken in close proximity to the trailhead? Having a more even spread in observations over the complete length of popular trails will provide researchers with a more representative view of the biodiversity that Canadians have access to. 

## **Where should you go?**

For this challenge we encourage you to go stretch your legs in the most popular parks throughout Canada. Which species you observe is not important: the more the merrier. The only requirement is that you are located at least 1 km away from a trailhead or road. 

For hiking inspiration you can look at the relevant park website!

## **Who created this challenge?**

This challenge was created for Blitz the Gap, designed by Lukas Van Riel, a PhD student at Université de Montréal looking into how climate change will impact Canadian forests.
