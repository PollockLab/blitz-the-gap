## What's the problem?
  
1 in 5 species in Canada are at some level of risk of extinction. Over 2,200 species are currently threatened nationally or within individual provinces and territories.  

At the same time, Invasive species cost the Canadian economy over $34 billion each year in damages and management. They outcompete native species, destroy habitats, and often go unnoticed until it’s too late. We have gathered a list of the most critically endangered native species, and the invasive species with the worst impact - CANADA’S MOST WANTED, and we need your help to get them!

## **Where should you go?**

Anywhere in Canada! Whether you're:
Hiking in a park
Walking your dog
Fishing by the lake
Walking to work or school
Going on a road trip

You Don’t Need to Be a Scientist. Just Be Curious. Photograph plants and animals anywhere in Canada. All it takes is your phone, a bit of time outdoors, and an eye for plants and animals. Your photo uploads make a real difference.
