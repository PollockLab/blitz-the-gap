## What's the problem?

There are an estimated # of seaweed species in British Columbia, but # of seaweed species make up #% of the observations on iNaturalist. B.C.'s coastlines host a huge diversity of seaweeds and we want to encourage you to observe more than just these # species. Read your local tide table and head down to the rocky shores at low tide, look under the canopy of larger kelps and see what you can find! Here are some resources to help you become an expert seaweed identifier!
