Blitz the Gap is a Canada-wide bioblitz to help us fill gaps in our knowledge of biodiversity in Canada. Canada is a large country and hosts tons of amazing biodiversity - which makes it a challenging place to survey. Though we’ve made progress thanks to community science platforms like iNaturalist, we are still lacking data for a whole host of ecological and conservation applications.

To assess at-risk species, track the changes in species’ ranges due to climate change, rapidly detect species losses and invasions, *we just need more data* - **and we need your help**!

# Challenges

To Blitz the Gap, choose from a series of challenges to fill biodiversity data gaps in Canada, according to what inspires you the most.

These challenges were designed by graduate students throughout Canada to help guide iNaturalists like you towards places that deserve a little more attention. Remember: even one observation can be enough to make a difference in our understanding of biodiversity change!

To participate, click below to join the Blitz the Gap iNaturalist project:

These challenges will automatically track any observations of species or places that are listed in the project. Check them our for more details of where to go and what to look for! The only exception is the **Hey birders, don't look up!** challenge: you will need to [join the project](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-hey-birders-don-t-look-up) and add your non-bird observations to it!

| Challenge | Priority Theme(s) | Description | iNaturalist | Maps & species lists |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Hey birders, don't look up!** | Species | Birders are the ultimate nature observers. This challenge aims to get birders to observe anything else (other than a bird) while they are out birding. | [![](https://static.inaturalist.org/sites/1-logo_square.png?1573071870){.center width="60"}](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-hey-birders-don-t-look-up) | [Details](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-hey-birders-don-t-look-up "Check the map!"){.btn .btn-success .btn role="button"} |
| **Make a splash!** | Places, Species | Dive in, and help us blitz the gap in freshwater biodiversity data! | [![](https://static.inaturalist.org/sites/1-logo_square.png?1573071870){.center width="60"}](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-make-a-splash) | [Details](https://pollocklab.github.io/blitz-the-gap/challenges/freshwater-challenge-template.html "Check the map!"){.btn .btn-success .btn role="button"} |

| **Canada's Most Wanted** | Species | Hey there! Would you be interested in contributing to conservation management; saving endangered native species, and calling out the bad guys (invasive species) at the same time? Over 2,200 species are currently threatened nationally or within individual provinces and territories. | [![](https://static.inaturalist.org/sites/1-logo_square.png?1573071870){.center width="60"}](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-canada-s-most-wanted) | [Details](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-canada-s-most-wanted?tab=about "Check the map!"){.btn .btn-success .btn role="button"} |
| **Made in Canada!** | Species | This project aims to document Canadian endemics--species that have most of their distributions within Canada | [![](https://static.inaturalist.org/sites/1-logo_square.png?1573071870){.center width="60"}](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-made-in-canada) | [Details](https://inaturalist.ca/projects/blitz-the-gap-made-in-canada?tab=about "Check the map!"){.btn .btn-success .btn role="button"} |
| **We are the 99%** | Places | Over half of all observations are found in just 1% of Canada's area.
