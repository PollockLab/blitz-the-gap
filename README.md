## Building the website

1. Set your working directory to the website repository folder, or open the R project.

2. To preview your changes locally, run `quarto preview` in the terminal. Always edit on the master branch.

3. To build the site locally, run `quarto render`. You must build the site before pushing any changes to this repository in order to ensure it is still buildable.

4. To deploy the website through GitHub Pages, run `quarto publish gh-pages` in the terminal. If you need to, push the automatic commit from the gh-pages (but it should do this after taking your GitHub credentials).
